Hi there, and welcome to my personal GitHub page! I am a Scientist from Saskatoon, SK registered as an Engineer-in-Training with APEGS. I like to think I have a diverse range of skills and research interests. My educational background was focused on environmental engineering and using naturally occurring microbial communities for industrial purposes such as groundwater remediation and bioenergy production (see thesis and capstone project). Nowadays, I am interested in learning python for scientific programming and data analysis.

I plan on using this blog to document the things I learn (maybe both professionally and personally) and to hone my writing skills.

Thanks for visiting!
